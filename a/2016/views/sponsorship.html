Monthly events are open to the public at no charge. At these monthly events, we join together to watch and discuss the latest Google Developer videos, demos, and tech talks </p> <p> Being a volunteer/nonprofit organization, our group relies heavily on sponsorships from local companies. These sponsorships come in many forms; providing food/drinks at monthly meetings, giveaways/swag, travel arrangements for a non-local speaker, annual {{ site.eventName }} conference venue/food/swag/etc fees, a venue for monthly meeting, etc. Through past contributions, {{ site.name }} has been able to bring the aforementioned and many other technologies and topics to hundreds of members here in the {{ site.location }} area over the past years. As a sponsor, your company gains exposure to hundreds of people in the {{ site.location }} area (and beyond) via our local group and social media channels. </p> <div class="centered"> <a ng-href="{{ site.sponsorURL }}" ng-click="gaClick('button', 'click', 'Become A Sponsor 2')" target="_blank" class="cta cta-default all-caps">Become A Sponsor</a> </div> </div> </div> </div> </section>
