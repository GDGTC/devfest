    <h1 id="abouttheconference">About the Conference</h1>

    <p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, February 2, 2019</p>

    <p><em>*Where: *</em>University of St. Thomas - Schulze Hall, Minneapolis, MN</p>

    <p>The first DevFestMN was in 2014 and is organized by GDG Twin Cities, a group of Google Developer practitioners
        and enthusiasts. The conference draws many of the best technologists from our region, as well as many Google
        employees who attend and present. This year we expect to have over 500 attendees join the event and share the
        experience.</p>

    <h1 id="whatwerelookingfor">What We’re Looking For</h1>

    <p>We’re always seeking a diverse mix of content and speakers for this community conference. Most sessions at
        DevFestMN are technical, but we’re also interested in submissions that discuss non-technical topics relevant to
        technology practitioners. Ultimately, we’re looking for speakers who have something interesting to say and are
        excited to share their knowledge with others. </p>

    <p>We welcome speakers of all experience levels, including those who have never presented before at a conference.</p>

    <p>If you’re looking for inspiration or examples of the type of content that would be a good fit for DevFestMN,
        please check out the sample topics at the end of this CFP or explore our past session <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/GDGTC/videos">video
            library</a>. </p>

    <h1 id="whyyoushouldpresentandhowwecanhelp">Why You Should Present and How We Can Help</h1>

    <p>DevFestMN is an opportunity to present to a friendly and engaged audience. This is a great way for you to share
        your passion, increase the strength of your network and advance your career. </p>

    <p>We’ll be hosting 2 Google Hangout sessions to answer your questions about this Call for Speakers, help you
        brainstorm and vet potential topics, or provide advice for making your content more engaging. Dates and links:</p>

    <p><a href="https://hangouts.google.com/call/kXj8ELFdbU73_BO9ekPIAAEE">Wednesday, October 10 6:00-7:00pm</a></p>

    <p><a href="https://hangouts.google.com/call/GkHW3U38BJjN7KHhl-VrAAEE">Sunday, October 22 3:00-4:00pm</a></p>

        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you need practice giving talks, get in touch, and we can connect you with local groups who may be seeking
        presenters.</p>

    <p>If you have a specific question that isn’t answered in those resources and you can’t make either of the Hangout
        sessions listed above, shoot us an email: info@devfest.mn (just don’t use this to submit a proposal).</p>

    <h1 id="theselectionprocess">The Selection Process</h1>

    <p>Here’s a rough outline for how we select the talks for DevFestMN:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Anonymize submissions, so we don’t bias against anything related to the submitting person.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Two rounds of voting:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The first round rates each talk on a scale from 1 to 10.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>The top-N (~50) submissions are rated again on a 3-point scale: "meh", “yay”, “MUST HAVE”.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>De-anonymize so we can (finally) bias against speaker details. </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>…and a number of details that we make up as we go along.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h1 id="sessionlength">Session Length</h1>

    <p>Most sessions are 45 minutes in length. If you want to leave time for questions and discussion at the end
        (completely optional), plan your presentation accordingly. We’ll also be organizing some sessions for 10 minute
        lightning talks and we’re open to considering a few 90 minute Codelab style sessions.</p>

    <h1 id="guideforspeakers">Guide for Speakers</h1>

    <p>Our attendees come to learn, so we’ll want you to shy away from sales pitches and anything that sounds like
        advertising. We welcome you presenting work you’ve done as long as it’s informational and instructive.</p>

    <p>All talks will be recorded and published on the internet for free, along with a recording of the slide deck,
        live-demo or other on-presenter-screen activity. We do this for the benefit of the larger GDG and tech
        community, and those who can’t make it to the conference. We hope you want to help out, but if you are in any
        way uncomfortable, let us know and we will work things out.</p>

    <p>We will ask to see your slides in advance of the conference to ensure the content is a good fit for our
        audience. </p>

    <p>Important Dates</p>

    <p><strong>Deadline for Submission: **Friday, November 2nd by midnight</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Notification of Acceptance: Friday, December 1st</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Deadline for Presentation Submission:</strong>
        Friday, February 2 by midnight</p>

    <h1 id="howtosubmit">How to Submit</h1>

    <p>Our best advice is to keep your submission short and sweet. We won’t impose a limit on length, but we suggest
        that it be no longer than 250 words. Engaging titles and descriptions tend to attract more attendees to your
        session, so we recommend spending some time fine-tuning this portion.</p>

    <p>When you’re ready, submit your application using this form:</p>
